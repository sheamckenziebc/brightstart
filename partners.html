                <h2>Turn-Key Construction & Tenant Improvements</h2>
                <p>Our construction partners specialize in healthcare tenant improvements (TI) and new builds. We manage the critical path scheduling for your project, from shell space to a fully functional operatory and sterilisation centre. Focus on CSA Z8000 standards for medical gas piping, HVAC HEPA filtration, and accessibility requirements, delivering a complete turn-key fit-out for your dental, medical, or veterinary practice.</p>

                <h2>CSA Z8000 Compliant Clinic Design</h2>
                <p>Our interdisciplinary design team (IDT) provides expert planning for optimal patient flow and infection-control zoning (on-stage/off-stage design). We develop detailed architectural and engineering plans, ensuring your clinic design meets all CSA Z8000 requirements, including ventilation (6-12 ACH fresh-air exchange for dental operatories) and medical gas systems. We handle the permitting process, ensuring your vision aligns with all regulatory body approvals, like those from the College of Physicians & Surgeons of BC.</p>

                <h2>Medical & Dental Equipment Supply</h2>
                <p>Through partners like Sinclair Dental, we facilitate procurement of high-value dental and medical equipment. We help you navigate CAPEX decisions with options for 100% equipment financing or leasing, including flexible upgrade paths to keep your technology current. From operatory chairs and digital imaging to central plant machinery, we ensure seamless integration into your clinic's design and construction phases.</p>

                <h2>Specialized Financing & Leasing Solutions</h2>
                <p>Secure the best financial terms for your practice transition or expansion. Our banking partners (e.g., RBC Royal Bank) offer specialized healthcare financing, including 100% financing for leasehold improvements and equipment, often at preferential rates (e.g., Prime â€“ 0.25% for established practitioners). We assist in structuring packages that bundle construction, equipment, and working-capital lines of credit (LOC) to manage cash flow during your ramp-up period. Our leasing experts (e.g., Spire Group) handle site selection and lease negotiations, securing favorable fit-out allowances.</p>
